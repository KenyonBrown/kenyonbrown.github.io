      <strong>Hi there! My name is Kenyon.</strong>
<br>
<!-- <br>

<br> -->
<p>I think about technology â€” applied to the themes of fitness, outdoor recreation, media, eCommerce, and the environment. <!-- Add data science, localization, and environmentalism -->
  I hope to have a fancy executive bio one day, but this will have to do for now. These-days, I'm supporting the growing enterprise client-base at <a target="_blank" href="https://tapcart.co">Tapcart</a>, where I help brands <!-- such as <a href='https://gritcycle.com'>Kylie Cosmetics</a> and <a href='https://sltnyc.com/studios/'>Princess Polly</a> --> design, launch, and market their mobile apps to the masses.

<p>Previously, I was a partner at <a target="_blank" href="https://ipstudio.co">IPSTUDIO</a>, a boutique fitness-focused web development agency. We helped COVID-19 affected fitness studios take their businesses online through the addition of a monetized video on-demand library.</p>
  <p>Prior, I was an early hire at <a target="_blank" href="https://marianatek.com">Mariana Tek</a>, where I led efforts accross studio activation and migration. We powered the biggest names in the industry from <a href="https://www.barrys.com">Barry's Bootcamp</a> to <a href="https://slthome.sltnyc.com">SLT</a>.
  After an explosive 2 years of scaling from 1 to 300 studio locations, the company was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-11-14/boutique-fitness-tech-disruptor-mariana-tek-now-backed-by-advent-international">acquired by Advent International.</a></p>
  <p>My startup journey began back in 2015, where I had just founded a company named <a target="_blank" href="http://siliconprairienews.com/2016/12/ames-startup-pollup-simplifies-hr-employee-polls/">PollUp.io</a> with a few friends from Iowa State University. We had no idea what we were doing, but <a target="_blank" href="http://siliconprairienews.com/2016/12/ames-startup-pollup-simplifies-hr-employee-polls/">PollUp.io</a> would soon become a multi-platform SaaS product that improved employee training, engagement, and retention through insights exposed via real-time polling.
    Back then, you would've found <a target="_blank" href="http://siliconprairienews.com/2016/12/ames-startup-pollup-simplifies-hr-employee-polls/">PollUp.io</a> in use at Land O' Lakes Inc. and Hy-Vee Grocery Stores.</p>
<p>If you're still reading, and interested in connecting, please feel free to reach out on any of the platforms below. I'm always open to learning new things and meeting good people. Cheers!</p>
