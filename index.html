      <strong>Hi there! My name is Kenyon.</strong>

If you just want to learn a little bit about me all you really need to know is that Iâ€™m originally from Iowa and grew up in an entrepreneurial family. After working at the family restaurants since an early age, I decided to join the startup community and founded a Human Resource technology company while I was attending Iowa State University. Nowadays, I'm working with the rest of the Mariana Tek team to enable Boutique Fitness studios to operate more efficiently.
