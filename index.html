If you just want to learn a little bit about me all you really need to know is that I’m originally from Iowa and grew up in an entrepreneurial family. After working at the family restaurant since an early age, I decided to join the startup community and founded a Human Resource technology company named PollUp.io while attending Iowa State University. <br><br>Through PollUp.io’s trial and error, I was lead to a startup in Washington, DC named Mariana Tek. To date, I'm now working with the rest of the Mariana Tek team to power a new generation of fitness studios.
