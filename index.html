If you just want to learn a little bit about me all you really need to know is that Iâ€™m originally from Iowa and have an entrepreneurial background. After growing up and working at the family restaurants I decided to join the startup community and founded a Human Resource technology company while I was at Iowa State University. Nowadays, I focus on helping technical organizations operate and scale.
