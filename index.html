<br><br>
If you're unaware of who I am, I'd be happy to give you a brief introduction. My roots are in Iowa, where my fasination in entrepreneurship and product development began. It was there where a lifetime of exposure to our family Ma & Pa restaurant cultivated me to build something of my own.
<br><br>During my Sophomore year at Iowa State University, I founded a data-driven Human Resource technology company named <a href="http://siliconprairienews.com/2016/12/ames-startup-pollup-simplifies-hr-employee-polls/">PollUp.io</a>. Two and a half years later, we were collecting meaningful data for Midwestern corporation's such as Land O'Lakes and Hy-Vee through our native iOS, Android, and Web App (a milestone that came with a lot of grit and gratitude).<br><br>However, due to capital depletion, PollUp.io was liquidated and disolved. I've since relocated to Washington, DC to join a startup named Mariana Tek. To date, I'm now working with the rest of the Mariana Tek team to power a new generation of fitness studios.
