<p>Unaware of who I am? Well I'd be happy to give you a brief introduction. My roots are in Iowa, where my fasination in entrepreneurship and product development began. It was there where a lifetime of exposure to our family Ma & Pa restaurant cultivated me to build something of my own.</p>
<p>During my Sophomore year at Iowa State University, I founded a data-driven Human Resource technology company named <a href="http://siliconprairienews.com/2016/12/ames-startup-pollup-simplifies-hr-employee-polls/">PollUp.io</a>. Two and a half years later, we were collecting meaningful data for Midwestern corporation's such as Land O'Lakes and Hy-Vee through a multi-platform experience. However, due to capital depletion, PollUp.io was liquidated and disolved in the Spring of 2018.</p>
<p>A few weeks later I relocated to Washington, DC to spearhead client onboarding efforts for an exciting fitness technology startup named Mariana Tek. To date, Mariana Tek has been acquired by Advent International, and is scaling internationally to power a new generation of fitness studios. This Spring, I left the company in search of new opportunities to work on exceptional products.</p>
